### Hotel-Room-Booking App

```
A Responsive Web App with API Integration and User-Friendly Form

The web app that you described is a responsive application that is built using jQuery and Bootstrap. It consumes an API and displays the data in a user-friendly way. Additionally, it features a form that allows users to submit their details and book a hotel room.

The app has been designed to handle all edge cases, including validations, API errors, and placeholders while the API is loading. This ensures a seamless user experience for users, regardless of the circumstances.

To book a hotel room, the user can select from at least two types of rooms (e.g., Standard Room and Premium Room) and add them to their cart. The user can then submit their personal information, such as name, email, phone number, and address, to complete the booking process.

Overall, this responsive web app provides a simple and intuitive way for users to book a hotel room, with all the necessary features to ensure a smooth and reliable experience.
